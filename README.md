# Lego Freak's Wet Dream: An Interview at Denmark's Jewel

Iâ€™m a Lego freak. This goes back as far as I can remember. My mom would tell me that I would sit with the Lego sets, following instructions, in complete silence, for hours on end. No food, no bathroom break, no reaction to questions. I remember the feeling of being entirely engrossed in the process, tunnel-zoned in on building. In fact, I believe that it is the last time I felt a true flow without even knowing it.

So I recently applied to work as a data analyst intern at the famous Lego Group in Denmark. As part of the job interview process, I received the following take-home assignment:

You are asked to use the provided dataset and database schema to understand the popularity of different Lego sets and themes. The idea is to become familiarized with the data to be ready for an interview with a business stakeholder.
