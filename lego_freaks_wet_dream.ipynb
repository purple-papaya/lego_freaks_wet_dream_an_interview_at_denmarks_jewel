My mom would tell me that I would sit with the Lego sets, following instructions, in complete silence, for hours on end. No food, no bathroom break, no reaction to questions. I remember the feeling of being entirely engrossed in the process, tunnel-zoned in on building. In fact, I believe that it is the last time I felt a true flow without even knowing it.\n\n![IMG_0684](IMG_0684.jpeg)\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Fig. 1: Me building Lego in Oct 1994.</figcaption>\n\nSo I recently applied to work as a data analyst intern at the famous Lego Group in Denmark. As part of the job interview process, I received the following take-home assignment:\n\nYou are asked to use the provided dataset and database schema to **understand the popularity of different Lego sets and themes**. The idea is to become familiarized with the data to be ready for an interview with a business stakeholder.","metadata":{},"id":"f8b70d12","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Create a report to summarize your findings.

popularity of different Lego sets and themes by answering key questions about the average number of sets and parts released per year, the most popular colors used in Lego parts, the proportion of transparent parts, and the 5 rarest Lego bricks. The results showed that there is an average of 356 sets released per year, with an average of 2,507 unique non-spare parts per set. The 5 most popular colors in Lego parts are black, white, light bluish gray, red, and dark bluish gray, in that order. Furthermore, 5.6% of unique non-spare Lego parts are transparent. The 5 rarest Lego bricks are two torsos, two heads, and Duplo Baloons, all from specialized themed sets.\n\nAs a lifelong Lego fan, I was beyond thrilled to have the opportunity to prepare this analysis for an interview with the Lego Group. I have cherished playing with Lego sets since I was a child, and I wanted to use this analysis as a way to showcase my passion and knowledge for the brand. \n\n![IMG_0675](IMG_0675.jpeg)\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Fig. 10: My Apollo 11 Lunar Lander in 2023.</figcaption>\n\nI was determined to provide a comprehensive understanding of the popularity of different Lego sets and themes, delving into key questions such as the average number of sets and parts released each year, the most popular colors used in Lego parts, the proportion of transparent parts, and the 5 rarest Lego bricks.
